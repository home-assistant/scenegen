# SceneGen

Scenegen is a scene generation tool for [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) home automation software. It creates scenes by example, by reading the current states of devices and outputting a corresponding scene. Scenegen is written in python using Home Assistant's RESTFul API so can be run from anywhere. It currently supports lights and switches only.
